    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>My writing explores the emotional underbelly of domesticity, primarily through short fiction and personal essays. I focus largely on femininity, with much of my work delving into the tumultuous yet tender link between mother and daughter. Probing the great hidden depths of life's mundanities, my prose strikes a delicate balance between the simple and the heartbreakingly raw. With touches of dry humour I tease confronting truths out of situations that may, at first glance, seem unspectacular. My writing holds a mirror to the reader and asks: do you like what you see?</p>
